# WDKit
WDKit is a portable web development tool that comes with PHP, Apache, and MariaDB version managers. Designed to make it easy for developers to manage PHP versions and setup Apache servers and MariaDB databases, WDKit offers native, no-installation support.

WDKit does not include executables for PHP, Apache, or MariaDB, but can automatically download and install all three with an internet connection. With its portable architecture, WDKit allows developers to take their entire development environment with them anywhere, without the need for complex setup on each device.
